                <h2>What Is a Leap Year?</h2>
                <p>We use leap years to keep our (solar calendar - Gregorian) calendar in sync with the seasons. How do leap years work, and how often do they occur? Leap years are years where an extra, or intercalary, day is added to the end of the shortest
                    month, February. The intercalary day, February 29, is commonly referred to as leap day. Leap years have 366 days instead of the usual 365 days and occur almost every four years.</p>

                <h2>Why Don't We Add a Leap Day Every 4 Years?</h2>
                <p>If the tropical year was precisely 6 hours longer than a calendar year with 365 days, we could use the Julian calendar, which adds a leap day every 4 years without exception. The deviation would grow to exactly 24 hours over 4 years, and
                    Earth would need exactly one day to catch up to the position in its orbit where it was 4 years prior. However, the deviation between the common year and the tropical year is a little less than 6 hours. The Gregorian calendar addresses
                    this by employing a slightly more complicated set of rules to determine which years are leap years. It's still not perfect, but the resulting deviation is very small.</p>

                <h2>Who Invented Leap Years?</h2>
                <p>Leap years in the western calendar were first introduced over 2000 years ago by Roman general Julius Caesar. The Julian calendar, which was named after him, had only one rule: any year evenly divisible by four would be a leap year. This
                    formula produced too many leap years, causing the Julian calendar to drift apart from the tropical year at a rate of 1 day per 128 years. This was not corrected until the introduction of the Gregorian calendar more than 1500 years
                    later, when a number of days were skipped to realign our calendar with the seasons.</p>

                <h2>How to Calculate Leap Years</h2>
                <p>In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The year must be evenly divisible by 4;</li>
                    <li>If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year;</li>
                    <li>unless... The year is also evenly divisible by 400.</li>
                    <li>Then it is a leap year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                    According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2500 are not leap years.
